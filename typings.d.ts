     *   LaunchDarkly, such as an invalid environment ID. All flag evaluations will
     *   therefore receive default values. This will always be accompanied by `"ready"`.
     * - `"error"`: General event for any kind of error condition during client operation.
     *   The callback parameter is an Error object. If you do not listen for "error"
     *   events, then the errors will be logged with `console.log()`.
     * - `"change"`: The client has received new feature flag data. This can happen either
     *   because you have switched contexts with {@link identify}, or because the client has a
     *   stream connection and has received a live change to a flag value (see below).
     *   The callback parameter is an {@link LDFlagChangeset}.
     * - `"change:FLAG-KEY"`: The client has received a new value for a specific flag
     *   whose key is `FLAG-KEY`. The callback receives two parameters: the current (new)
     *   flag value, and the previous value. This is always accompanied by a general
     *   `"change"` event as described above; you can listen for either or both.
     *
     * The `"change"` and `"change:FLAG-KEY"` events have special behavior: by default, the
